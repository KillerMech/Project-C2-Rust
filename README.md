<H1>Project C2 Rust</H1>
<H2>This is my capstone project</H2>

For this project it is recommended that you have rustup installed rather than
basic Rust. rustup is a Rust foundation project that allows you to manage
multiple versions of Rust on your system. This will also allow you to use
cross which is a tool that makes it easy to cross compile the agent to other
platforms.

I'll add more in here soon.
